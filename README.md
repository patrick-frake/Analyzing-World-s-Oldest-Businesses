## Analyzing World's Oldest Businesses (SQL) 
Syntax used: INNER JOIN, MIN, MAX, COUNT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, LIMIT, HAVING

## Overview
The database contains three tables. I utilized INNER JOIN and other SQL skills to analyze the world's oldest businesses. These results can give actionable insights to anyone who is planning on starting their own business or anyone expanding their existing business into other markets. 

## Insights
This project allowed me to reinforce my knowledge on joining multiple datasets to analyze further. Having 3 data sets allowed me to practice multiple inner joins in the same querie to combine all 3 data sets together.
